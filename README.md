# COSC420 Assignment 1 - Neural Networks
## A simple Neural Network written in Java
Compile with "make"  
Use "make run" to run compiled program  
Program can take command line arguments:  
e = Show Population Error and Epochs every 100 epochs  
w = Show the final Weights  
a = Show the activation of all nodes in the Network  
l = Loop the program for a specified number of times  
If looping, then second argument should be an integer  
e.g. make run awel 10
